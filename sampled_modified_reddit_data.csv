Conservative,0,Libertarian,15,"The comeuppance of Gen X Was watching the super bowl last night and during the halftime show something really struck me: Gen X will have it's comeuppance in politics.  The boomers will become less relevant, and a new generation will take over. 

I was 15 years old when I got a copy of The Chronic on cassette (1993).  That was damn near 30 years ago. None of the other songs performed  last night were less than 20 years old. This puts me at late Gen X (1977; now 44 y.o.)

If our country can hold itself together for another 10 years it'll be Gen X who has the time and money to run for office. As the boomers are doing now, Gen X will have the chance to reshape our government in accordance with their values. Its hi-fucking-larious that Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre have become the standard bearers of at least a portion of those values. Anti-police, pro-gun, anti-drug war. 

Gen X will inherit this government. The super bowl halftime was just a friendly reminder.

Liberal,57,SocialDemocracy,57,"Why is the UK labour party a failed political party? The title is a bold statement, yet I would argue that it is true. The UK Labour party has not held power for 11 years, and will most likely not get a chance to regain power until they reach 14 years in opposition. But this is not a unique situation. The Labour party has for a long time been defined by its inability to gain and then keep power. This has resulted in a tory-dominated UK. Why is this the situation? What systemic issue is social democracy facing in the UK? What could be done to address it?"

>As quoted in A Short History of Progress (2004) by Ronald Wright: ""John Steinbeck once said that socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires."" This has since been cited as a direct quote by some, but the remark is very likely a paraphrase from Steinbeck's article ""A Primer on the '30s."" Esquire (June 1960), p. 85-93:  
>  
>**""Except for the field organizers of strikes, who were pretty tough monkeys and devoted, most of the so-called Communists I met were middle-class, middle-aged people playing a game of dreams. I remember a woman in easy circumstances saying to another even more affluent: 'After the revolution even we will have more, won't we, dear?'** Then there was another lover of proletarians who used to raise hell with Sunday picknickers on her property...""  
>  
>**""...I guess the trouble was that we didn't have any self-admitted proletarians. Everyone was a temporarily embarrassed capitalist. Maybe the Communists so closely questioned by the investigation committees were a danger to America, but the ones I knew — at least they claimed to be Communists — couldn't have disrupted a Sunday-school picnic.** Besides they were too busy fighting among themselves.""

Liberal,19,SocialDemocracy,14,"Proposal for how a market socialist ""stock"" market could work Hello,

So I know that this sub is mainly soc dems and dem socs, but I honestly think you guys can get on board with this too. Will post in other subs as well.

So, the whole idea of a market socialism is that the workers own the companies they work at. I like that idea for a lot of reasons, but one very common criticism is that these coops may have trouble with funding. I have spent a great deal of time thinking about this issue and I have come up with several solutions. I have discussed three of them elsewhere (bond market, credit unions, and crowdfunding) but now I have an idea that I think even a capitalist would agree would work on a large scale.

Here it is:

So the issue that a lot of coops are trying to solve is the same that I have with capitalism: the right to absentee ownership. Basically, the idea is this: If a capitalist buys some machine and hires a worker to work on it, the capitalist can take some of the money generate by the worker so long as they own the machine (the worker doesn't get full value of labor). It would be fair for the capitalist to be compensate for the cost of buying the machine, but not have profits from it forever. If the worker ever says ""hey, screw this, I don't want to send excess money to the guy sitting around doing nothing"" then the capitalist can use police or the state to reclaim their property. Essentially the worker is forced to work at a lower rate than what they provide.

This is the key problem with capitalism (for me at least). We could argue about that issue, but that's not the point of this post. The point is my solution. So if the issue is permanent private absentee ownership, wouldn't it be ok if the coop sold a futures contract based on some preferred stock (non-voting stock representing some ownership of the firm and entitlement to profits). Basically the idea is this: A futures contract is a legal entity wherein an asset is agreed to be bought or sold at a particular price at a particular time. So what if the futures contract was tied to preferred stock (meaning the coop would buy back the stock at a given price and time). This would allow temporarily allow trading of stock in the coop. It would not be permanent, as it is time limited, and, because the workers are the ones writing the deal, they would set it up so that the value coming from trading the stock at that time is greater than any cost, thus ensuring no worker exploitation (they're not gonna try and exploit themselves or undersell themselves, they want the highest price possible).

In short, you basically have a stock market that's actually based on futures contracts based on preferred stock. Right now, many coops have investor members and owners of stock, and others sell preferred stock, so this could be built on already existing systems.

&#x200B;

What do you think? Any critiques/criticisms? Any way this can be improved?

Thanks!"

>He refused to compile GDP statistics arguing that such data was not useful to managing an economy and would lead to officials meddling in the economy. He was once asked what the key thing that poor countries could do to improve their growth. He replied: **""They should abolish the office of national statistics.""**

This banning of even collecting statistics is even more anti-government than most libertarians I've seen.

Liberal,0,SocialDemocracy,17,"Am I the only one irked by president Biden pledging to nominate a black woman to the supreme court? I hate to say it but I agreed with what Ted Cruz said even though I'm pretty left wing. To me this seems like an extension of the kind of corporate social justice spreading into our government where it absolutely need not be.

I mean we're not talking about pledging to hire a black women to be the head of some rinky dinky Gatorade factory down in Florida, we're talking about the damn supreme court.

The supreme court should consist of the most knowledgeable legal scholars in the country, we should be judging who we bring onto the supreme court by their knowledge and practical experience rather than by their damn race, religion, age, sexuality, gender, and/or economic status. I mean, Is that a crazy thing to say?

I remember being given the position of Vice President of my high school chapter of The Future Business Leaders of America (I'm 19 now and barely graduated high school, I know that has literally zero comparison to the being a supreme court justice). I remember working harder than any of the other people running. I wrote a 1,000 word essay as to why I should be VP while the other candidates wrote as much 100 words, I talked to the members of the FBLA to gain their support, I walked around the school trying to get more people to join the club. I wanted that position and I got it!

Now, if you told me I got the position because I was a gay arab man well I would punch you in the face (Don't mess with me I've been working out and taking boxing classes. JK!). You see to gain a position just because of immutable characteristics is extremely unamerican. You work hard, you gain experience, you teach yourself. That's what it's about not race and I know luck has so many things to do with it such as being born into a rich family.

Of course for me I would love to see a gay arab man become a supreme court justice that would be absolutely amazing! But I would only love to see it, if it was deserved, because what does it matter if a gay arab man becomes a supreme court justice if he wasn't the most qualified candidate. I want to see a gay arab man rise above the heterosexuals, the whites, e.t.c.. I want to see him rise because of his grit, hard work, persistence, and knowledge not because he's gay and arab.

Just had to share this because it's really bothering me lately how many people that I watch want to say that people don't support this because they're racist, but that is so far from the truth."

Confronted with plunging prices, incomes and employment, the government balanced the budget and, through the newly instituted Federal Reserve, raised interest rates.  By the lights of Keynesian and monetarist doctrine alike, no more primitive or counterproductive policies could be imagined.  Yet by 1921, a powerful, job-filled recovery was under way.

Neyerere was born into the family of a cheif of the Zanaki People on the 13th April 1922, during his childhood he stayed with his mother (one of his father's many wives) and assited her with farming and other domestic tasks. the communal living style of the Zanaki people would later have an infuence on the Political beliefs of Nyrere. During the 1930s, due to beings a cheif's son Nyerere was allowed a western style education, during his education he was noted as an exellent student, it was here that he was first exposed to Christianity, becoming a Catholic in 1942 following the death of his father. He adopted the ''Christian name'' of Julius following his conversion, although was said to have remaked that the custom of taking a Christian name following a batism was ''silly''. Between 1943-47 Nyerere was in higher education at the Makerere collage in Kampala. During the late 1940s Nyerere worked as a teacher, and briefly as a price inspector for the local government. during this time he met, fell in love with and subsequently became informally engaged to Maria Gabriel (despite being in an arranged marrage to a young girl back in his father's village) at the same time he also began to become involved in politics joining the Tanganyika African Association (which wanted decolonisation and liberation from Imperialism for Tanganyika) between 1949-52 He wet abroad to study at Edinburgh Univercity. Following his return to Tanganyika in 1953, Nyerere Became an active decolonisation activist, he urged fellow anti-Imperialist to be as non-Violent as possible and is alleged to have been an an adirer of Mahatma Gandhi's non-Violent campaigns in India.

Following growing Pressure form the Tanganyika African Union (of which Nyerere was a prominent member) the British eventually Left Tanganyika in 1961. In 1962 Nyerere, who by this point was already a well know political and anti-colonial figure, was elected president. He would rule the country from between 1962-1985, during this time he pursued agricultural collecitvisation, education and literacy campaigns, and forged close links with other Socialist Nations - Notably Mao's China. Despite his close links with Marxist states, Nyerere was not a Marxist-Leninist and while he was in Office Nyerere delevloped his own unique form of African Socialism called [*Ujamaa*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujamaa)*.* In 1964 Zanzibar unified with Tanganyika to form the nation today known as Tanzania. In 1967 Nyerere issued the Arusha declation that afffermed his and his party's commitment to building a democratic, and Socialist Sociaty in Tanzania. Another notable achievement of Nyerere's was the 1978 invasion of Uganda, which ended the Tyranical reign of Idi Amin. In 1985 he steped down as leader of the CCM and advocated for a multy party system to be developed in the country, he did however continue to avocated for the CCM an Ujamaa in the late 80s- early 1990s.

Nyerere Died of complications from Leukemia in a London Hospital 1999, he was 77. His body was flown back to Tanzania and given a state funeral. Today he is greatly respected in the country and seen as the father of the nation.

A monopoly is a single seller while a monopsony is a single buyer. In the labor market, firms are the buyers of the labor that workers sell. Aside from restricted cases, there are no literal monopsonies. What we're really interested in is if there is concentrated power on one side in the form of some price setting power as opposed to price taking predicted by perfect competitive market conditions. We could call the ability to price set wages on the part of firms ""monopsony power.""

If you believe in monopsony power, you can justify a range of labor policies as being economically efficient, such that minimum wage laws and collective bargaining wouldn't lead to unemployment. So whether or not it exists feels very important to establish. Failing to establish labor market monopsony means conceding that strong labor policy sacrifices employment for some people (though it's a bullet you could perhaps make a case for biting.)

A counter I've heard is that low skilled laborers actually have a lot of firms available to them to work for. Going from a low skilled job to a completely different low skilled job, let's say from being a construction worker to being a retail worker, doesn't have high transition costs compared to say switching from being a chemical engineer to being a computer programer. Therefore low wage, low skilled workers ought to be experiencing less monopsony power than high skilled workers.

The good counter counter I've heard is job search frictions are what really causes monopsony power for most low skilled workers. Perfectly competitive labor economic theory predicts that any firm that attempts to set wages would lose all of its workers immediately. I'm sure there would be an increase in turnover, but a firm probably wouldn't lose literally all its potential workers. Partially because people don't perfectly monitor their other options, partially because of a prospect theory type thing where people are more likely to act to avoid loses than to gain, and partially because changing jobs is stressful, involves considerable cognitive effort and possibly even moving to really maximize income. That might give employers some leeway in being able to price set.

What are your thoughts though? Does it exist? Why does it exist? Can we point to good empirical evidence that it exists?"

I go to work today and in the middle of trying to load about 5 trips of steel at about 1 ton each trip my co-worker leaves... ""I need to get to the bar"" he says. I'm pretty frustrated because yesterday he left and made a bunch of incorrect holes in some plates that I was working on so I stayed late and fixed them all.

I arrive at work and another co-worker immediately comes complaining and telling me I have to help him find a drill chuck. He doesn't have the time he says. My boss had informed me that I needed to deliver a beam to a jobsite so I didn't have time either.

Both of these co-workers are huge believers in their uncompensated value. They both believe that the company is exploiting them and that they aren't paid enough. Hogwash I say. Neither will lift a finger if I'm struggling with something. They think my boss is the problem but it's them...

I start school at 7:30 AM. My first break is from 9:20 - 10. My next one is from 11:20 - 12:30. I get out of class and go directly to work at 2:20. I'm off between 8-10 depending on homework. They think I shouldn't complain because I brought this on myself. 

I think they shouldn't complain because they are lazy assholes who deserve every ounce on misery they get. Someday if I own a business, I will treat the crappy employees like crap. I will reward the good ones with all of the money they earned and the money I would have paid the lousy workers if they weren't terrible employees. I will think of all the terrible co-workers in the world and I will hope that it's their kids that I'm taking unearned raises from and giving them to the workers who deserve it

Liberal,2,SocialDemocracy,6,"I am having trouble understanding Steve Keen's criticism of the Labor Theory of Value, would love some help Hi,

I am relatively new to marxist theory (sorry), but I have long been fascinated by economics in general.

So anyways, I recently listened to this podcast: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwavxl-w\_Z4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwavxl-w_Z4)

which interviews Australian Post-Keynesian Economics Professor Steve Keen.

I am currently trying to understand his critique of the Marxist Labor Theory of Value.

He starts to talk about it around 29:40 for those interested, and expands until about 35:00-ish.

Anyways,

This is my understanding, is this correct:

The use value of labor power is the value it can create, i.e. the value and use value of labor power are the same. This means, that the surplus value of labor is measured by taking the Exchange value and subtracting the value (use value) from it. So Surplus = Exchange - use.

The exchange value of labor is its wages, and its use-value is the value of the products it can create.

A similar logic applies to machines. Their use value is what they can produce. And the exchange value is the price of production.

Therefore they too can create a surplus value.

I asked this of a Marxist and the response I got was this:

>Machinery can't add any value because this constant capital will regulate the socially necessary labor time on a given market. Which means once every capitalist has the same technology / machine, the only thing that will regulate the profit / value creation is the abstract labor itself

&#x200B;

But I don't feel that really touches on the argument Keen is making right? Because Marx was using the whole use-value exchange-value paradigm to prove the labor theory of value right?

I checked the wikipedia and found this part, which I really didn't understand:

>Keen further observes that while Marx insisted that the contribution of  machines to production is solely their use-value and not their  exchange-value, he routinely treated the use-value and exchange-value of  a machine as identical, despite the fact that this would contradict his  claim that the two were unrelated.[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value#cite_note-57)  Marxists respond by arguing that use-value and exchange-value are  incommensurable magnitudes; to claim that a machine can add ""more  use-value"" than it is worth in value-terms is a [category error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_error). According to Marx, a machine by definition cannot be a source of *human* labor.[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value#cite_note-58)[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value#cite_note-59)  Keen responds by arguing that the labor theory of value only works if  the use-value and exchange-value of a machine are identical, as Marx  argued that machines cannot create surplus value since as their  use-value depreciates along with their exchange-value; they simply  transfer it to the new product but create no new value in the process.[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value#cite_note-60) Keen's machinery argument can also be applied to [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery) based modes of production, which also profit from extracting more use value from the laborers than they return to laborers.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor\_theory\_of\_value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value#Karl_Marx)

Is my understanding of Keen's criticism correct?

So ultimately he argues that a machine can create a surplus. But,

>Machinery can't add any value because this constant capital will regulate the socially necessary labor time on a given market. Which means once every capitalist has the same technology / machine, the only thing that will regulate the profit / value creation is the abstract labor itself

means that it's wrong to say machines are a source of value?

From common use one can make the conclusion that reactionary=conservative, but is it though?

from wikipedia:

> In political science, a reactionary or a reactionist is a person who holds political views that favor a return to the status quo ante, the previous political state of society, which that person believes possessed positive characteristics absent from contemporary society. 


From the above description I would make a conclusion that a reactionary is someone that does not necessarily have an ideology on how things should be, but simply prefers things to a prior state of things - left or right. For example if a conservative government made a change that I dislike and want to revert it, it would make me a reactionary. Another example, someone sympathetic to the soviet regime wanting things to go back as they were (I'm from the Baltics) is also a reactionary. But a conservative party implementing Reagan/Thatcher type economic reforms in the Baltics would not be reactionary as there was never a precedent for them, but still could be considered conservative?

This would make reactionaries VERY context specific.

Also, left wingers wanting to go back to some type of new-deal type economics could be also considered a reactionary?

Edit: it seems like ""reactionary"" tends to have negative connotations, and for me it seems to be - ""it depends""."

I have asked around but I think people assume I am a troll or an idiot so I just decided to make a post.... I have always liked the ideas about individual freedoms and the ability to have complete agency over your life which is why I am here. One of the main questions that arise in my mind now that I take a serious look at libertarian ideas is how we address the question of big business. I am curious what your guys thoughts are about, what I would see as, the natural path of big business unhampered by regulation. I think back to learning about Standard Oil or Carnegie Steel etc and how they eventually bought up everything from the natural resource sites, to the means of transporting it, to the factories making the products etc... making it essentially impossible to enter the market as a small business.  With the lack of competition, or even with competition, when I look back at times with less regulation I see things like workers being paid at subsistence rates and massive income inequality. I see things like the triangle factory fire where the factory was literally locking people in to work. 100+people per 1 toilet etc. I kind of feel like if left unhampered big corporations would become incredibly powerful. They already manipulate the government with their massive amount of power and money, it seems if they could have it their way they would get rid of all regulations on them all together and are glad to have libertarian support in that way. Is there a general consensus on how to approach these difficult topics without government intervention?  As a side note, it almost seems like you'd end up in a new age feudal Jeff Bezos/Elon Musk run city if you really took it to the extreme, nothing would stop someone that rich from raising a private army/police force right?

Conservative,6,Libertarian,12,"Thoughts on the Difficulty of a Libertarian movement in the US This is a follow up to a comment I made on a post about property rights.

Consider for a moment why we have rights.

Rights seem self evident, they seem to justify themselves, there is no need for religious or moral arguments for things like free speech, freedom of the press, due process of law etc. but why do we have these things?

The answer is that we have rights, and a need to exercise them when we do things that others do not want us to do.

Who exercises free speech? We all do, but we only discuss the **right** to freedom of speech when people say contentious things about large groups of people who get mad about it. Consider the Westboro Baptist Church, they are almost always mentioned in Free Speech discussions, and why? They do things which a lot of people disagree with (admittedly, many do agree with them).

In terms of property for example, if a libertarian party advocated for stronger individual property rights, that is quite agreeable.

But consider on a local scale, some neighbors advocating for increased property rights would likely come at the detriment of some other person in that neighborhood. One  person saying ""I want the right to start a business at my home without government intervention"" and that persons neighbor might say ""I want to live in a neighborhood which is free from the busyness which a business brings"".

Both of these people would like their individual rights recognized and vindicated, yet if either person got their rights vindicated, it would come at the detriment of the other.

So a libertarian advocating for more property rights in general gets into a bit of a pickle, who's rights are better? Do we just ask the entire neighborhood? What of the neighbor who does not get their way, they have been deprived of something they desire simply due to his local majority opinion, and perhaps that is how democracy is supposed to work.

I do quite like this sub, I think we have great discussions here and I believe that we all have each others interests in mind, regardless of your tilt to the ""left"" or ""right"", but I have come to a conclusion that if we want to create a movement with a focus on individual liberty, we must prioritize something beyond just vindicating individual rights and the free market. I do not know what that thing is, or should be, and perhaps the idea of a focused, institutional goal is against what some believe libertarianism is all about.  I invite suggestions and other thoughts. I just feel that in today's society, solutions to our problems are not as always as simple as shortening the arms government. Though, if somebody can suggest otherwise I would be happy to hear"
