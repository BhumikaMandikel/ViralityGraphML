freefolk,"Where Stannis is going in the books is yet to be determined, and R'hllor is notoriously unreliable, especially when it comes to prophecies.

&amp;#x200B;

The House of the Undying shows Dany much of what is to come, but also throws at her things that may not necessarily come true but are shown to her by her own imagining -- Rhaego is a prime example of this, but the visual also shown to her of her silver mare in a forest stream is another that could never possibly come true but is merely derived from her own imagination. Those were not prophecies given from an unbiased source, but rather one who had an active desire to kill Dany and distracting her with such images was a good way to lull her into a false sense of security. We can't take them entirely at face value.

&amp;#x200B;

The Prince Who Was Promised is a legend that has driven other people to madness in its pursuit. It's not some one-off imagined image in Dany's head or some bullshit Mel saw in the flames and misinterpreted. It's something that almost definitely happened in the past, and will happen again, like basically every other legend and myth in the ASOIAF mythos. It was a legend that was created in the wake of the creation of the White Walkers, and some crazy shit had to have happened for them to have had the ability to create the Wall. Unbiased sources have nothing except 100% accurate prophecies in their dreams and in their cryptic statements.",0,1

It’s worth noting that shitty regimes have done good things in the past. You need to consider whether the State is actually acting for the greater good (and if it will long term), if it’s carrying that duty out effectively, and whether doing so is worth the crushing of the rights and liberties of individuals.

There is a history reference I believe I read in World of Ice and Fire where 2,000 unsullied held the line against 15,000 Dothraki screamers. Had the Dothraki attempted to Flank the Unsullied they would have crushed them but they just kept charging and smashing. Its just what they fucking do! They were also most likely expecting a lumbering force of skeletons and not a crushing 15' wall of death. Had it been just some lumbering force then I assume the fight would look a bit more like when stannis just rode through the wildlings like grass. Night time or daytime wouldnt matter a damn bit especially when they are hopped up on that flaming sword buzz. Also... What the fuck else were they supposed to do? ride around the potentially million strong force that stretches for miles?

I do feel fucking horrific. I was driving home from work yesterday and caught myself seriously considering driving off of a bridge. Scared me. So, this is my first step to addressing some of this, small as it may be. 

I actually don't have a therapist. I used to be on anti-anxiety meds and antidepressants. They made me feel numb and suicidal, so I tried dealing with things in my own way. Doesn't look like that's gonna cut it anymore. 

As far as the relationship goes. I laid it all out this morning. Told her I loved her, that I was willing to work through any issues. This was violently rejected. Started talking about all my flaws, and shoved my mistake in my face.

The reason Hillary lost isn’t because she was attacked in the primary. It was because those attacks were largely true. If anything Bernie should have hit her harder, and then maybe the weaker candidate wouldn’t have won the primary.",1,0

freefolk,"There were 6 - 8 White Walkers present in the Godswood behind the Nightking, not hundreds. And while they were shown to have supernatural abilities, those abilities consisted of Stuff like superhuman strength or constantly radiating a Cold Aura, not enhanced reflexes (infact they move really slow all the Time, not fast) or Superior Senses, One of them got successfully ambushed by Jon &amp; Crew in Beyond the Wall even after he had noticed their fire ffs, they definitely do not have magical detection abilities.

There we're hundreds of Wights standing around,  but they were all facing away from her approach, and they only do something when ordered to do it. Wights aren't traditional Zombies, they have no drive of their own. The Nightking offered them to Stop moving, and so they did. All she had to do was move past the 6 Walkers that had escorted the Nightking in, then Jump. 

&gt; somehow get past the thousands upon thousands of wights inside winterfell 

Arya started moving towards the Godswood when the Dead were just starting to get in, and before the Nightking raised the Second Batch. Jon only started to move towards the Godswood afterwards, from further away, and still allmost made it until Viserion crashed into the Gate leading to the Godswood and forced him to Stop just outside.

gameofthrones,"1) war is different. It’s easy to sit at home and say ‘do this.’ It’s another thing to actually do it. 
2) seasoned war veteran does not equal infallible. From American history, general custer was facing a very large Indian army, and he split his army. He also, to the detriment of his army, refused weapons and extra soldiers for one of his battles. And that’s just a quick google search. I’m sure history is full of brilliant tacticians that made obvious mistakes. Hindsight is 20/20. Of course we can sit and think of better strategies. We can look at any war and think of some better way to do it. But at the end of the day, they’re battling a myth that you can’t prepare for. No amount of rearranging would have won that war by force. Mistakes happen in wars, and they’re deadly and they happen. 
3) of course it has to look cool. We (well some 😂) pay for hbo. I doubt you want to sit and watch hours of round table style discussion about where to place troops. We pay to see the magic dragon lady fly around. You’re fighting for realism in a world with dragons against a zombie army and an ice man after a prepubescent all knowing raven. You’re right, cool isn’t a good battle strategy, but I don’t think any strategy would have won them.

Ghosting is one of the cruelest things a person can do to another. I’m not talking about blocking someone after a bad date or having things fizzle out on a dating app. I mean ending a substantial relationship this way. About the only way it can be justified is if the person is harassing you or you have a legitimate fear of violence from them.

People talk about it like it’s just rude or bad etiquette. It’s far beyond that. It’s gaslighting, it’s mental terrorism, it’s a complete denial of that person’s autonomy and their right to know whether they are in a relationship or not. It’s extremely common for people who are ghosted by long term partners to have mental breakdowns or fall into serious depression.

She did. She's saying she doesn't want him to approach her, as her friend warned he might. But that was at the bottom of the post, I assume some readers didn't quite make it there.

&gt;He still chose her.

While high off his titties. lmfao As soon as she started blabbing about their arrangement to their friends in a desperate attempt to make it official he ran away in utter fucking humiliation. So your ""guess"" about why he ""chose her"" is really weird because he like. Didn't. He literally fucked her for/while on drugs and then ran away. Doesn't make him innocent but don't go making up some weird story about him falling madly in love with his coke dealer because his ex was somehow worse.

&gt;too embarrassed to be honest with you. Bullshit. He knew what the hell he was doing. He was doing drugs and fucking other women.

Oh, I don't doubt that he was humiliated but I do agree with you here, he's no better than the chick.

&gt;Get some counseling for your co-dependency

Again, she already moved on, if you get to the bottom of the post she very clearly said she doesn't want him back and doesn't want to see him so her concern is not wanting him to even show up. I get that, they were together for 4 years and yeah, it can feel humiliating and kind of disgusting at first to find out you've been cheated on. It really hasn't been that long since she found out, she doesn't have to want him back to still feel grossed out and betrayed. If you can flip a switch and suddenly feel nothing negative that fast, you've probably got a personality disorder you may want help for.",0,11

I'd like to believe that, but Dany pulled her hand away from Sansa and frowned when she asked about Northern Independence. Dany has shown zero tolerance toward the idea of Northern Independence, and until I see otherwise, it will continue to be a problem unless one side gives.

You say she showed Jon all of that? Yeah she did and that's why he bent the knee (that and because he loved her). But aside from fighting in this war, (which she was given the North beforehand in exchange, so she got something out of it), what has she done to show the North who she is?

*****
&gt; The United Nations added Masood Azhar, leader of a Pakistan-based armed group, to its list of &amp;quot;Global terrorists&amp;quot; on Wednesday after China lifted its objections to the move.

&gt; The UN sanctions committee on the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and al-Qaeda announced in a press release the designation of Azhar - the chief of Jaish-e-Muhammad - over his ties to al-Qaeda.

&gt; The sanctions committee accused Azhar of &amp;quot;Participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing, or perpetrating of acts or activities&amp;quot; carried out by JeM. UN diplomats said the request was again submitted to the committee and China had not opposed the move to blacklist Azhar.

1. Do YOU truly want to be with him? Not do other people think you should or shouldn’t be, but do you want to spend your life with him still even after what was done.

2. If the answer is “yes”, then what does he need to do in order for you to truly want to be with him still. Other than the obvious not call you names, look at other women. Think of things YOU want from him. It can just be attitude adjustment to little things like maybe a foot rub every now and then. You say you always please him sexually, so what do you want, you are a team remember.

3. What are you willing to compromise on? Can you honestly forgive him for what he said? Would you be able to possibly do a date night more, things like that. 

4. If you think you want to make it work, maybe see a couples therapist. Myself and everyone on here are just random people with know actual professional opinions. It might be a good idea to get one if you honestly might want to end your marriage.

But nah, cinematically speaking I think you have to have music at some points or it becomes too much straight battle and battle noises, which can become monotonous. I think, especially at the end where the NK makes it to the godswood and everything seems to stop as he approaches Bran, there needs to be music there. Same with Jorah making a last stand to defend Dany. Otherwise, it would be too quiet. Just wouldn’t fit. And the music choice, spot on in my opinion.

politics,"&gt;He could have charged Trump. There is no law saying the president can't be indicted.

Wasn't his job. That's for Congress to do. Whether or not you agree with Mueller tasking Congress with fulfilling their duty (hint: the Republicans won't) is another matter. After Comey's influence on 2016, it is easy to see why he wanted to follow procedure. To deny the Republicans the ability to twist his actions against him and the nation. There is no law, but why give them ammunition if you don't have to?

&gt;He could have interviewed Trump. He couldn't be bothered.

You don't know what his agenda looked like before it was obviously cut short by Barr's fuckery. Something of this magnitude requires strategic moves, and he may have been out-played on that battle, but it doesn't seem like he needed it anyway if you read the report. More than enough to nail Trump's flabby ass in there. 

&gt;He could have interviewed Jr or Kushner and thrown them in jail for all their crimes. He let them off completely.

See previous. You still don't know what all was handed off to NY. The folks who actually can make moves Trump can't pardon away.

gameofthrones,"At first viewing of this episode I was pretty pissed at the ending, thinking the showrunners messed this up but in the end I think GRRM told them a few things that have applied here: there are a few magical beings (NK, 3ER, LOL). It’s possible bran is the lord of light but regardless, these are the 3 beings that have powerful abilities. There’s other magic in the world, obviously dragons and faceless men. 

The white walkers know they have a few advantages on mankind. One is that they can turn the numbers against them so they will always win battles. The other is patience- they can wait forever until they get the right opportunity. They know that men make stupid mistakes so they plan to wait until that happens. They also know that only a few weapons can hurt them, and the evidence is that they used to fight with no armor but then once they encountered Jon, they started wearing armor and mostly didn’t engage men, just used their wight advantage strategically. They can always outsmart men. 

Mankind’s best defense against them has been the 3ER. I think that power also comes from the COTF since it’s connected to the weirwoods and this was their attempt at balance. The 3ER is the only one that can beat them, because they can analyze the past, see everything in the present and see the future. A disciplined, unemotional person with these powers that can be properly trained is able to beat the NK. That’s why they are mortal enemies. 

Bran made mistakes, mostly because he didn't finish his training, which is how the white walkers were able to get south of the wall. First mistake was yelling at his father but it ended up being harmless. He got in trouble with his teacher but didn’t learn. Second was getting marked by the NK. Third was Hodor. He finally learnt that you can’t mess with the past. 

But he still tried to outsmart the NK and failed miserably. When Bran warged into ravens last season he thought the WWs were marching to eastwatch, alerted Jon and their stupid plan happened. Men make stupid mistakes and that plan was how the NK trapped them in that same spot, and got his dragon. Now he has a way south of the wall and knows exactly where his enemy is. Major strategic advantage. Brans mistake was once again thinking he could change the situation. 

The 3ERs true power is being able to see the future and use that to his advantage to form a plan. This time around Bran didn’t let people know what he saw he kept it to himself. He played chess and that’s how he won. Watch the scene where he gives Arya the dagger again....he knew it was important and he lingers on the dagger when giving it to her. He knew what she would do with it. He mostly kept his mouth shut after that, only providing the bare minimum of details. He said he’d wait in the Godswood and that the NK would come for him. He had seen the future but didn’t say so. Didn’t say he saw a vision of Arya. The ink is dry, just let it play out. 

The NK outplayed the entire battle. He knew people would make mistakes. They made mistakes having soldiers in front of trenches cuz they could get swarmed. They didn’t have dragons sitting on top of the castle killing wights, as soon as NK flew down, Jon and Dany took the bait. Chase him instead of let him come to you, well that let his army overrun the castle. Any show or force he can match, dragonfire, or any man to man combat. He can use his advantage of the dead. He almost won. 

Bran won because he lured the NK into a trap. He had to willingly sacrifice all those people in order for it to play out. He looks at the NK closely, probably finally downloaded his history because of it. He looks down at the area he will get stabbed which kinda intrigues the NK who almost stopped Arya. Arya is the only one who could get to him cuz she’s sneaky. Jon would have made noise getting there and get swarmed again. 

Bran processed the information and let it play out. He won. Checkmate. 

The PTWP/AA/Last hero are all prophecies which are really just stories. Stories that get embellished and changed over time. The story of one man facing down the white walkers to get them to retreat never made any sense. More likely, the Last Hero was the first 3ER, and through that magic they found a way to scare the white walkers (possibly by being the first to recognize weapons that could kill them). But think about how complicated that story would be to tell for thousands of years!! Each generation, the story changes slightly, and ends up being a last hero who saved the day against all odds. Since most people never expected a new long night, the story took a life on its own. 

GRRM is on record saying that prophecies are mostly fallacy, and so I think this is actually his story, not the showrunners. I believe he told them the broad strokes of how the WWs were going to lose, and he basically said he didn't know yet who would kill them, but that it would end up being a simpler reason than all that speculation around it. This is typical GRRM, he introduces a complex world, but the story resolution is mostly due to human action, not magic. 

""There must always be a Stark in Winterfell""...maybe the original 3ER saw the future, but they didn't know when or who it would be that defeats the NK, but that it would be at ""Winterfell"" and it would be a Stark. Again, it's usually the simplest answer. 

So it was never going to end that way with the WWs, only with Bran and that’s how it ended. 

I think next episode Bran will finally tell people this story, and maybe even the NKs story. I bet the NK has a really tragic human story, like a happy family life that was taken away from him and forcefully turned into the ice demon. I bet the transformation was brutally painful and then society was scared of him when he returned and he was angry that love was taken from him and he was forced to live forever without love. I hope we get that info from Bran next week and not in the prequel",0,1

gameofthrones,"That wouldn't work, because he would be really suspicious that Winterfell seemingly has no defenses and no army protecting it at all, yet that's apparently where Bran is located. A small hidden force would still be massacred, and even more quickly.

It's like how in Return of the King, that the only way for Frodo to get the ring into Mordor unseen by Sauron was for the rest of his friends and allies to march up to the front gates to distract the massive army he had. 

Same concept here. A huge stand had to be made so the Night King would be delayed getting to Bran as much as possible, while also making him believe that they were mounting a massive defense because Bran was there, and that this was their only chance to stop him.",0,0

freefolk,"&gt; And it was made such beautiful sense because it parallels real life too. It really would've been amazing to see the Night King bring the winter and sweep through Westeros!

I second that and never in any of my imagination, either through fleaks or otherwise, I would have thought the NK story line would have been done away with halfway through the season, so that they can focus on the political aspect in the other half.

&gt; And I'm sick of the argument: BuT tHe ShOw Is CaLlEd GaMe Of ThRoNeS!!1! Well the series is called A Song of Ice &amp; Fire, which is exactly what the show is based on!

Exactly. And the other argument is that it is the show and not the books. Well the entire story of the show is completely based on the books. Even the endings for major characters are going to be the same. 

&gt; that the silly little game of thrones that the kings are playing matters not because the greater threat is approaching! And it was made such beautiful sense because it parallels real life too. 

Without being too harsh on them, getting this message across should have been the first priority rather than plot twists and unexpected surprises. Climate change is one of the real life examples where there is no choice for humanity but to unite and do their bit.

nba,"It’s not the warriors tho it’s the Rockets. The warriors didn’t even pioneer their style it was based off the 14 Spurs.

The Warriors play beautiful  basketball and don’t even shoot that many 3s. They just happen to have some of the great shooters of all time. Although their ball movement isn’t the same with Durant

The small ball defense wasn’t even then either The Heatles did it first with Bosh at the 5.

I guess you could say the Warriors or Steph demonstrated the value of a lot of 3s and Morey and the Rockets took it to the extreme. 

The basketball I don’t like is Spamming PnR and only shooting 3s while removing fundamental aspects of the game like post play and midrange. Sure it’s more effficent but it’s dumbed down in a sense. 

Regarding rule changes it would be to dumb down the amounts of 3s being taken because some teams literally take 50% of their FGA from 3 and I think that’s detrimental to the game. 

New rule changes would be intended to bring balance back to the game and bring back post play and the viability of the midrange game.  The point being to encourage diversity in basketball.",0,3

gameofthrones,"The tactics in this episode were truly awful. Any 8-year old who's played 2 hours of Total War could cone up with a better plan.

The Dothraki should not have straight up charged into the army at the start. Dothraki are light cavalry. Light cavalry doesn't engage in melee unless the enemy is reaaally spread out. Any kind of formation is death to them.

Previous seasons established them as good horse archers. They should have hidden out of sight until the wights reached the walls, then move in to strike them from all sides at once, pummeling them with arrows. If they give chase, kite them around till they are spread out and charge them when and where they are thin. If they don't chase you, keep firing arrows over and over. Never ever charge into massed infantry.

The Unsullied were wasted as well. They should not have been outside. Move them onto the walls, where their long spears can hit the wights long before the wights reach the top. With 8000 Unsullied, the entire walls would be filled with 2 lines, allowing the second line to back up the first in case some wights did break through.

The siege engines were an atrocity. Why were they in front of the infantry, in front of the trench and in front of the wall? Why did they stop firing after the Dothraki were clearly dead? Why spend so much time building siege engines if you don't plan on using them?

The siege engines should have been behind the walls. On towers, roofs, platforms or in open areas. Won't fit is not a thing, as siege engines are made for a single battle. Make them fit. With how densily pavked the wights were, a single boulder could destroy as many as 10-20 of them. They fired multiple boulders in less than a minute, so keeping up one shot every minute or so wouldn't be a stretch. Imagine how many wights could be killed by a dozen of tjese things firing for a full hour?

The the light infantry, the Nigjt's Watch, wildlings, levies and the other people tjey managed to scramble together. Why were they on the front line?! Light infantry is used to protect the flanks (which, behind walls, there is no need for especially with the huge amount of light cavalry available. The other main use is to fill gaps in the lines. Keep them as mobile reserves and use them where the lines get broken.

As for the Knights of the Vale. Why were they dismounted? Does nobody realize how devastating heavy shock cavalry armed with lances is? Either place them outside the castle to help the Dothraki harrass the wights, or inside the castle to counter any breakthrough.

And then the dragons. The most devastating weapon in the arsenal and they did... Very little. Jon sat on the wall waiting for the NK, while Daenerys was out looking for him. Why not do sweep after sweep and burn the army of the dead to the ground? The NK will come anyway and he'll be hard to miss flying over the battlefield. No need to engage him on his terms.

And the army tactics weren't even all of it. The fortifications were equally bad.

The trench should have been 50m further away, and only be lit after the wights reached the bottom of the castle. That way they don't have enough to assault the walls, you can kill thousands with arrows, they won't be able to run or hide and their allies can't support them. Extending the trench to the wall at one point allows you to easily light it by throwing down a single barrel of flaming oil.

Speaking of burning oil: Where was it? Burning oil and other boiling substances were used all over the medieval period to great extend. Light the wights up by tossing burning oil, barrels and other things at them.

The gate should have been filled with all the trash they could find to make breaching it much harder. The windows and doors boarded up. Set up roadblocks in every street. Make the wights have to spend serious manpower for every meter. Anything to slow them down.",0,1
